If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP\/2 request the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up.

If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP\/2 request the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP\/1.1.

In a proxy case users may assume the content-length is validated somehow which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP\/1.1 connection the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked.

In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP\/2 request the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP\/1.1. If the request comes in as an HTTP\/2 stream gets converted into the HTTP\/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest` `HttpContent` etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP\/1.1 this may result in request smuggling. In a proxy case users may assume the content-length is validated somehow which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP\/1.1 connection the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP\/2 to HTTP\/1.1. For an example attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected if all of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP\/1.1 objects and these HTTP\/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer.
